## [JS Notional Machine](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/defining-what-does-it-mean-to-understand-computing/)


The __notional machine__ is a set of diagrams and vocabulary you can use to accurately describe how JS is executing behind the scenes without getting weighed down with details of implementations.  Your brain will build a [mental model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K_sxBUGx8A) of what JavaScript does during program execution one way or the other.  Instead of letting this happen by chance, explicitly learning a notional machine for JS will enable you to learn correctly the first time around.  The notional machine don't need to be precise down to the EMCA specifications, instead it needs to accurately describe what is relevant to the task at hand. While first learning to code this list includes:
* How JS steps through source code
* Static source code vs. dynamic runtime
* Variable initialization & reassignment
* Functions: 
  * Definition vs. Execution
  * Are Objects _and_ executable procedures
  * Scope vs. Context
* Execution frames
* ...
 
Your brain will construct an understanding of how JS works whether or not you intentionally guide it, it's what brains do.  As great as this sounds it is really very dangerous.  JavaScript is a complicated language and it is very easy to come up with explanations that work for simple excercises but are not accurate.  You won't notice at first, but as soon as you try to move on you will find it nearly impossible to understand what's going on.  Unlearning and relearning how JavaScript executes is very difficult and will take much more time than learning it right from the beginning.

To help you build your Notional Machine, use [PythonTutor (for JavaScript)](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) _all the time_.   Even when you think you understand what's happening.  It's more important to build a precise understanding of machine execution than it is write a lot of code. So even if feels like step-throughs are just taking time away from practice coding, keep at it.  Writing more code doesn't help if you're learning the wrong things from it.

Stick to it!  Step-throughs aren't glamorous but they will help you learn JS better and faster than you thought was possible.

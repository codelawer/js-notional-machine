## [JS Notional Machine](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/defining-what-does-it-mean-to-understand-computing/)



The __notional machine__ is a set of diagrams, visualization, refactoring techniques, and vocabulary you can use to accurately describe how JS is executing behind the scenes without getting weighed down with details of implementations.  Your brain will build a [mental model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K_sxBUGx8A) of what JavaScript does during program execution one way or the other.  Instead of letting this happen by chance, explicitly learning a notional machine for JS will enable you to learn correctly the first time around.  The notional machine don't need to be precise down to the EMCA specifications, instead it needs to accurately describe what is relevant to the task at hand. While first learning to code this list includes:
* How JS steps through lines of source code
* Static source code vs. dynamic runtime
* Variable initialization & reassignment
* Functions: 
  * Definition vs. Execution
  * Are Objects _and_ executable procedures
  * Scope vs. Context
* Execution frames
* ...
 
Your brain will construct an understanding of how JS works whether or not you intentionally guide it, it's what brains do.  As great as this sounds it is really very dangerous.  JavaScript is a complicated language and it is very easy to come up with explanations that work for simple excercises but are not accurate.  You won't notice at first, but as soon as you try to move on you will find it nearly impossible to understand what's going on.  Unlearning and relearning how JavaScript executes is very difficult and will take much more time than learning it right from the beginning.

To help you build your Notional Machine, use [PythonTutor (for JavaScript)](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html) _all the time_.   Even when you think you understand what's happening.  It's more important to build a precise understanding of machine execution than it is write a lot of code. So even if it feels like step-throughs are just taking time away from practice coding, keep at it.  Writing more code doesn't help if you're learning the wrong things from it.

Stick to it!  Step-throughs aren't glamorous but they will help you learn JS better and faster than you thought was possible.

## [JavaScript in Order](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-in-order)

The best way to learn JavaScript is from the [inside-out](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-in-order), focusing first on how your code is interpreted and how memory is managed then later learning to apply this to practical problems. Unfortunately most introductions to JS cover the language from the outside in, focusing on the most interesting or intuitive features first and directly apply them to programming challenges.  This approach will feel satisfying at first but will quickly slow your progress as you have difficulty separating JS behavior from strategy bugs.  


Instead, take a look through [JavaScript in order](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-in-order).  It's a guide to JavaScript that builds your understanding of the JS Notional Machine from the inside out focusing first on how the JS engine interprets your commands, building from the simplest concepts of program execution and errors all the way up to more complicated features like contextual free variables.  After mastering JavaScript's inner workings you'll find [problem solving strategies](https://github.com/colevandersWands/top/#strategy) are much more approachable.

[JavaScript in order](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-in-order) is not just a better explanation of JS.  It's an entirely different approach encouraging you to learn JS by visualizing and studying the behavior of carefully designed snippets, building your own correct understanding instead of learning our best explanation.
